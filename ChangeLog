vsntp change log

2013-11-13
	Does not work on x86_64 yet.  Don't know whether it still works on i386.
	I don't have i386 anymore.
	 1. vsntp.c: Removed the weird method to calculate the next time line
	    for synchronization.  It was my bad taste to synchronize at the
	    the time of multiples of interval.  When many clients are
	    synchronized to a same server, synchronizing them at a same time
	    will overload the server and create DDoS.  Thanks to the reminder of
	    Steven Shen <fbishen@gmail.com>.
	 2. AUTHORS.zh-tw, INSTALL.zh-tw, NEWS.zh-tw, README.zh-tw, THANKS.zh-tw,
	    init.d/README.zh-tw: Converted from Big5 to UTF-8.  I'm not woking
	    on Windows anymore.  Big5 cause problem with gedit.
	 3. AUTHORS.zh-cn, INSTALL.zh-cn, NEWS.zh-cn, README.zh-cn, THANKS.zh-cn,
	    init.d/README.zh-cn: Converted from GB2312 to UTF-8.  I'm not woking
	    on Windows anymore.  GB2312 cause problem with gedit.
	 4. configure: Updated with GNU Autoconf 2.69.

2007-11-28
	 1. ChangeLog.zh-tw, ChangeLog.zh-cn: Removed.
	 2. COPYING.zh-tw, COPYING.zh-cn: Removed.
	 3. License updated to GPLv3.
	 4. Removed Traditional Chinese comments.

2004-03-29	version 2.0.0
	 1. vsntp.c: The syhchronization scheduler has been rewritten to
	    allow alternative schedulers, in order to work with the problem
	    reported by Jean-Alain Le Borgne <jalb@pobox.com> 2007-03-26,
	    that sleep() may not return after MS Virtual PC 2007 was suspended
	    for a while.
	 2. vsntp.c: An alternative schedular using alarm() was added in
	    addition to sleep(), based on the contribution by Jean-Alain.
	 3. vsntp.c: New subroutine setsigalrm() was added to set the SIGALRM
	    signal handler.
	 4. vsntp.c: New subroutine alarm_wakeup() was added as the alarm()
	    schedular.
	 5. vsntp.c: Two new constants SCHEDULER_SLEEP and SCHEDULER_ALARM were
	    added as the scheduler choices of the user.
	 6. vsntp.c: Two new switches -a/--alarm and -s/--sleep were added for
	    the user to choose the scheduler.  The default is currently -s.
	 7. vsntp.c: New variable "scheduler" added to as the scheduler choice
	    of the user.
	 8. vsntp.c: Variable "next" was made global so that the alarm()
	    scheduler can access it, too.
	 9. vsntp.c: Check the return value of synctime() so that skip logging
	    when time was not adjusted (time correct or network error).
	10. vsntp.c: Logging of time synchronization after the first time
	    was added, in log level LOG_DEBUG.
	11. vsntp.c: errstart is now calculated and maintained in synctime()
	    instead of neterror(), in order to log the time sequence of the
	    network errors.
	12. vsntp.c: Re-formatting error messages and warnings according to
	    the GNU Coding Standards, as:
	      source-file-name:lineno: message
            Refer to: http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Errors.html
	13. vsntp.c: Added logging before connect(), send() and recv() at
	    log level LOG_DEBUG in order to know the current progress when
	    debugging network problems.
	14. vsntp.c: Added logging of value t1, t2, t3, t4 and toff in log
	    level LOG_DEBUG in order to debug time calculation problems.
	15. vsntp.c: New subroutine xsigemptyset() was added to run
	    sigemptyset() and handle its error.  setsigalrm() was updated
	    to use xsigemptyset() instead of sigemptyset().
	16. vsntp.c: New subroutine xsigaction() was added to run sigaction()
	    and handle its error.  setsigalrm() was updated to use xsigaction()
	    instead of sigaction().
	17. vsntp.c: English comment fix.  "... and handle errors" was updated
	    as "... and handle its error."
	18. configure.ac: Added AC_TYPE_SSIZE_T, and added "alarm()" in
	    AC_CHECK_FUNCS, acccording to the suggestion by automake 1.9.6.
	19. configure.in and aclocal.m4: Regenrated using automake 1.9.6.
	20. configure: Regenrated using autoconf 2.61.
	21. vsntp.c: Added conditional #ifdef, so that if alarm() is not
	    supported on the target platform the alarm() scheduler will not
	    be compiled.
	22. vsntp.c: A new constant DEFAULT_SCHEDULER was added as the
	    default scheduler.
	23. Added init.d directory, with a Debian SysV init script, a Red Hat
	    SysV init script, a configuration file used by the init scripts,
	    and README in 3 languages.
	24. Added doc directory, and moved vsntp.texi, vsntp.8 and rfc1769.txt
	    inside.
	25. vsntp.c: Fixed the basic profile in the beginning comment, from
	    synctime.c to vsntp.c.  That was the first name of vsntp.  It was
	    renamed for years.
	26. vsntp.8: Fixed the BUGS chapter, replacing the originall text with
	    the SourceForge users' mailing list information.
	27. README, vsntp.8 and vsntp.texi: Added notes about the scheduler
	    issue.
	28. README, vsntp.8 and vsntp.texi: Added notes about how to debug.
	29. README, vsntp.8 and vsntp.texi: Added notes about portability.
	30. README, vsntp.8 and vsntp.texi: Added requests to users to let me
	    know that someone is using vsntp. :p
