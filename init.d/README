PREFACE

    Two SysV-styled init.d scripts are supplied with vsntp from 2.0.0,
together with one configuration file.  One of them is for Debian based
systems (Knoppix, Ubuntu... etc.)  The other is for Red Hat based systems
(Fedora, Mandriva... etc.)  They are not installed by default.  You may
install them so that vsntp will start as a daemon after each reboot.

    Installation is easy.  You have to be root.

DEBIAN BASED SYSTEMS

    Copy the files to their appropriate directory:

      # cp vsntp.debian /etc/init.d/vsntp
      # cp vsntp /etc/default/vsntp

    Edit /etc/default/vsntp to accommodate your environment.  Remember
to uncomment the line with "SERVER=" and change it to your local NTP
server.  Once finished, run:

      # /etc/init.d/vsntp start

    And watch the syslog.  vsntp shall start working.

    To run it every time the system boots, use update-rc.d:

      # update-rc.d vsntp defaults 23

    23 is taken from the start/stop order of the Debian ntp package.
You may set it to your preferred order.

RED HAT BASED SYSTEMS

    Copy the files to their appropriate directory:

      # cp vsntp.redhat /etc/init.d/vsntp
      # cp vsntp /etc/sysconfig/vsntp

    Edit /etc/sysconfig/vsntp to accommodate your environment.  Remember
to uncomment the line with "SERVER=" and change it to your local NTP
server.  Once finished, run:

      # /etc/init.d/vsntp start

    And watch the syslog.  vsntp shall start working.

    To run it every time the system boots, use chkconfig:

      # chkconfig --add vsntp
