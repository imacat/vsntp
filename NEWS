2013-11-13	version 2.1.0 (not released)
	 1. vsntp.c: Removed the weird method to calculate the next time line
	    for synchronization.  It was my bad taste to synchronize at the
	    the time of multiples of interval.  When many clients are
	    synchronized to a same server, synchronizing them at a same time
	    will overload the server and create DDoS.  Thanks to the reminder of
	    Steven Shen <fbishen@gmail.com>.

2007-03-29	version 2.0.0
	 1. Added alarm() in addition to sleep() as an alternative
	    synchronization scheduler, in order to fix a problem that vsntp
	    sleep() may stop working after MS Virtual PC 2007 was suspended
	    for a while, as reported and suggested by Jean-Alain Le Borgne
	    <jalb@pobox.com> 2007-03-26.  The codes are based on
	    Jean-Alain's contribution.  Thank you.  Two new switches "-a" and
	    "-s" were added for for setting the scheduler.  Currently the
	    default is -s (sleep()).  If you find vsntp stops synchronization
	    after running for some time, that the sleep() is not functioning
	    normally on your system, you may try to switch to alarm() using
	    the "-a" switch.
	 2. More debugging information were logged, in the syslog log level
	    LOG_DEBUG with log facility LOG_DAEMON.
	 3. Two SysV-styled init scripts are provided for convenience in the
	    init.d subdirectory.  Check the README file in that directory for
	    more information.
