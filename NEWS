2007-03-29	version 2.0.0
	 1. Added alarm() in addition to sleep() as an alternative
	    synchronization scheduler, in order to fix a problem that vsntp
	    sleep() may stop working after MS Virtual PC 2007 was suspended
	    for a while, as reported and suggested by Jean-Alain Le Borgne
	    <jalb@pobox.com> 2007-03-26.  The codes are based on
	    Jean-Alain's contribution.  Thank you.  Two new switches "-a" and
	    "-s" were added for for setting the schedular.  Currently the
	    default is -s (sleep()).  If you find vsntp stops synchronization
	    after running for some time, that the sleep() is not functioning
	    normally on your system, you may try to switch to alarm() using
	    the "-a" switch.
	 2. More debugging information were logged, in the syslog log level
	    LOG_DEBUG with log facility LOG_DAEMON.
	 3. Two SysV-styled init scripts are provided for convenience in the
	    init.d subdirectory.  Check the README file in that directory for
	    more information.
